            <p>Artificial Intelligence is the ability of machines to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as understanding language, recognizing images, solving problems, or making decisions.</p>

                <h2 id="question">What is the difference between AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</h4>
                <button class="btn">+</button>
            </div>
            <p>AI is the broad idea of machines being able to act intelligently, while Machine Learning is a method within AI where systems learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Deep Learning goes a step further by using layered neural networks to solve complex tasks like speech recognition and image analysis.</p>

                <h2 id="question">Where do we use AI in daily life? </h4>
                <button class="btn">+</button>
            </div>
            <p>AI is already part of our everyday activities, from voice assistants like Siri and Alexa, to recommendation systems on Netflix and YouTube, to navigation apps, chatbots, and even spam filters in email.</p>

                <button class="btn">+</button>
            </div>
            <p>AI itself is not dangerous, but the way people use it can be. Misuse of AI for creating deepfakes, biased decision-making, or privacy violations are real risks, which is why ethical guidelines and responsible development are so important.</p>

                <button class="btn">+</button>
            </div>
            <p>AI can automate repetitive or routine tasks, but it cannot replace creativity, empathy, or critical thinking. Instead of fully replacing jobs, AI will change the way we work and open up new kinds of roles in the future.</p>
